To begin, you would want to insert values into the command-line as described in the lab writeup, eg:
    train <examples> <hypothesisOut> <learning-type>
                    or
    predict <hypothesis> <file>

If the first statement is run, the output will be whatever name you had for <hypothesisOut>.
If the second statement is run, the output to the console will be a bunch of guesses for the language.

The suggested method is - train example.txt hypothesis.txt dt/ada
                            then
                          predict hypothesis.txt test_examples.txt
